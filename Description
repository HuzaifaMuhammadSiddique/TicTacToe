"""This repository contains the code for the famous TicTacToe game. 
It is built using classes and objects in python. The game has three players:
the human player, random computer player, and intelligent AI player.
You can interchangeably play with both of the players.
The AI player is created using the minimax algorithm.
To commence the game, run the main_game file.
Special thanks to kying18 for helping me create this game.
It was impossible for me to create this wonderful game without her YouTube video.
